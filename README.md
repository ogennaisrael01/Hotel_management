### Hotel Management System (CLI-Based)

 * A simple yet powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) Hotel Management System built with Python. It allows you to manage guests, rooms, and bookings efficiently from the terminal.

 ### Features

 - Add new rooms to the hotel

- Add new guests

- View all rooms and guests

- Book a room for a guest

- Cancel or update a booking

- Delete a guest

- Check room availability

- View booking history

- Clean, interactive CLI interface

### Booking Logic

* Only available rooms can be booked.

* Guests cannot book the same room twice for overlapping dates.

* Cancelled bookings are not deleted, only marked as cancelled for audit purposes.
